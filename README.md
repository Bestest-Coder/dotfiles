# Bestest Dotfiles

My system dotfiles and nix flake config for my systems

## Systems

### Hoid
<!--
![Hoid](https://coppermind.net/w/images/HoidPromo.jpg)
-->
My Framework 16 Laptop (forthcoming, probably mid-february)  
Named as such because it will probably be the center of my development, and will (hopefully) be perpetually expanded and built upon

### Ien
<!--
![Aon Ien](https://coppermind.net/w/images/Aon_Ien.svg)
-->
My Clockwork Pi uConsole with R-01 RISC-V core, to potentially be replaced with RPi CM4  
Named as such because Aon Ien means Wisdom in Aonic, and the compact size of the system and primary use being communication is pretty much a Seon

#### SD Image Build Instructions
(Currently Broken)
```bash
nix build .#images.ien
```
