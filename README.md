# Bestest Dotfiles

My system dotfiles and nix flake config for my systems

## Systems

### Hoid

My Framework 16 Laptop (forthcoming, probably mid-february)
Named as such because it will probably be the center of my development, and will (hopefully) be perpetually expanded and built upon

### Ien

My Clockwork Pi uConsole with R-01 RISC-V core, to potentially be replaced with RPi CM4

#### SD Image Build Instructions
(Currently Broken)
```bash
nix build .#images.ien
```
